## Project Overview

**Description**:  
CrediMatch is a decentralized dating platform leveraging the Polkadot ecosystem and **KILT Protocol** for decentralized identity registration. The platform enables users to create verifiable, privacy-focused profiles using self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials, ensuring authenticity and trust. By integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs and AI-driven matchmaking, CrediMatch prioritizes security, privacy, and meaningful connections in the online dating space.

**Key Features**:  
- **Verified Profiles**: Registration with KILT Protocol ensures genuine users.  
- **Privacy and Security**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs protect sensitive user data.  
- **AI-Driven Matchmaking**: Intelligent algorithms for compatibility-based pairing.  
- **Token-Based Incentives**: Reward systems for engagement and platform participation.  

**Technology Stack**:  
- **Blockchain/Parachains**: Polkadot, KILT Protocol  
- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Rust-based components  
- **Other Tools**: IPFS for decentralized storage, Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy
