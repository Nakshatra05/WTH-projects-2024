## Project Overview

**Description**:  
PolkaCupid is a decentralized dating platform built on the Polkadot ecosystem. It utilizes the **KILT Protocol** for secure, self-sovereign identity registration, enabling users to create verifiable, privacy-focused profiles. By integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs, PolkaCupid ensures data privacy while fostering trust and authenticity. The platform also features AI-driven matchmaking and token-based rewards, delivering a secure, engaging, and meaningful dating experience.

**Key Features**:  
- **Verified Profiles**: Registration via KILT Protocol ensures authenticity.  
- **Privacy and Security**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs safeguard sensitive information.  
- **AI-Driven Matchmaking**: Compatibility-based pairing powered by intelligent algorithms.  
- **Token-Based Rewards**: Incentivize user engagement and participation.  

**Technology Stack**:  
- **Blockchain/Parachains**: Polkadot, KILT Protocol  
- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Rust-based components  
- **Other Tools**: IPFS for decentralized storage, Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy
