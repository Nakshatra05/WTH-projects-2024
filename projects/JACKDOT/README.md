### Project Overview  

#### Description:  
JackPot is a decentralized betting app built on Polkadotâ€™s parachains, leveraging bonding curves for dynamic pricing and rewards distribution. It offers a transparent, engaging platform for users to pool bets and win rewards, with a focus on inclusivity, social interaction, and blockchain security.  

By utilizing parachains like Moonbeam, Frequency, and SubSocial, JackPot delivers a scalable, decentralized solution with integrated social features, ensuring a fun and community-driven experience for all participants.  

#### Key Features:  
1. **Dynamic Pooling with Bonding Curves:** Price of entry increases as participants join, ensuring a fair distribution of value.  
2. **Transparent Rewards System:** Randomized draw for winners with bonding curve-based reward allocation.  
3. **Social Features and NFTs:** Shareable achievements, leaderboards, and collectible NFTs enhance user engagement.
